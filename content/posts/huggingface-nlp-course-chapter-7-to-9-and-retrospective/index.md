Wrapping up [ðŸ¤— Hugging Face: NLP Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course).

## Chapter 7: Main NLP Tasks
Chapter 7 is another repository of copy/pastable snippets. A lot of the topics covered already appeared in previous chapters though (e.g. Token Classification, Question Answering).

## Chapter 8: How to Ask for Help
If you're coming from a Software Engineering background you can safely skip this chapter entirely. It covers reading stacktraces, how to post questions, open GitHub issues, and a very basic use of `pdb`.

## Chapter 9: Building and Sharing Demos
Not much here. Mostly an advertisement for [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/).

## Retrospective
The topics covered in the course are interesting. There are enough small gems hidden in the material to be worth the time. But I'd be very liberal with skipping redundant or irrelevent chapters.

To me mostly chapter 2, 5, and 6 outshine the rest of the course for learning purpose. While the other chapters can only be used as repo of ready to use toy examples for most standard NLP tasks.
