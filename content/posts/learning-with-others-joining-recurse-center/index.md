Today I'm excited to join a community of learners. For the next 12 weeks I'm going to participate in the Fall-2 2023 [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=dcdcd5fced9bfab4a02b4dd6bb05199e) batch.

## What is it?
If this blog is "learning in public", Recurse Center is "learning with others". RC is a code retreat for self-directed passionate programmers. It's a place to work on your own projects and learn new things, surrounded by other people doing the same. 

## My plan
I want to continue my journey from SWE to MLE and take the opportunities being surrounded by a community of learners provides to accelerate my own learning.

### Learn (more) in public
The more eyeballs around the more power you can leverage from learning in public.

### Teach to learn
Richard Feynman is attributed the quote _"If you want to master something, teach it."_

I want to use my stay at the Recurse Center as an opportunity to teach what I learn to others. As a way to share joy with other, and selfishly as a way to solidify my own understanding of the topics at hand.

### Learn from others
I am hopping to collaborate on projects, review material in a group, and pair program with others to learn from their experience and tap into their unique understanding. See a subject from a different set of lens.

### Building Intuition and Analogies through pounds of clay
One more concept borrowed from Richard Feynman is to build Intuition through Analogies. What I wish the most is to leave the retreat with an intuitive understanding of ML. And I plan to achieve that by going through a lot of very minimal barebone toy projects.

In the RC community there is a term for that: "Pounds of Clay". According to RC's historians the term is a reference to [this story](https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/) and the driving hypothesis it to speedup your learning by finishing many small imperfect projects rather than one bigger "perfect" project.

## How can I join?
If that sounds fun to you. [Learn more about RC](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=dcdcd5fced9bfab4a02b4dd6bb05199e).
