# TL;DR

Hey, I'm peluche!


# About

I am a Software Engineer/Pentester/ML enthusiast. I spent the last 8 years working at [Google](https://about.google/) on Distributed Systems, Hardening, and general problem solving.

I [love fantasy books](https://www.goodreads.com/peluche) and I have a dream that one day [Patrick Rothfuss](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/108424.Patrick_Rothfuss) will release book 3. I play [Go/Weiqi/Baduk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) online.
